### 3.4 使用正则表达式检测词组搭配

#### 正则表达式的常见模式及实例

![img]({{ site.baseurl | prepend:site.url}}/images/re.png){: .center-image }

<br>

#### 轮到你来

> 插入符号“^”匹配字符串的开始，就像“$”符号匹配字符串的
> 结尾。如果我们不用这两个符号，刚才例子中我们会得到什么样的结果

```python
# 会不受开头结尾控制，多匹配出中间满足条件的单词，如unobjected。
```

>来看一些“手指绕口令”，只用一部分数字键盘搜索词汇 。例如:
>«^[ghijklmno]+$ »，或更为简洁的 :«^[g-o]+$ »，将匹配只使用中间
>行的 4、5、6 键的词汇，«^[a-fj-o]+$»将匹配使用右上角 2、3、5、6 键
>的词汇。“-”和“+”是什么意思?

```python
# ‘-’是至，可以用于表示字母或数字的省略。
# ‘+’是表示匹配一个或多个模式。
```

> 研究前面的例子，在你继续阅读之前尝试弄清楚\，{}，() 和|这些
> 符号的功能。

```python
# ‘\’表示转移，用于表示产生歧义的字符。
# ‘{}’指定匹配re的次数，其中如果只填一个数字表示精确匹配这个次数，{1,3}指定次数上下限，省略表示小于等于上限和大于等于下限。
# ‘()’用于限定范围。
# '|'表示从其左边的内容和右边的内容中选择一个。
```

<br>

### 3.5 正则表达式的应用

#### 提取字符块

```python
# re.findall() 用于找出所有(无重叠的)匹配指定正则表达式
# nltk包中的Text对象也有findall()方法，其作用与re.findall()一致
```

<br>

#### 括号与问号

括号一般用于指示范围，同时在使用findall()时，返回值会根据括号的范围有所变化，即返回括号中间的内容：

```python
>>> re.findall(r'^.*(ing|ly|ed|ious|ies|ive|es|s|ment)$', 'processing')
['ing']
```

如果不想使用括号限定返回值，可使用`?:`加在括号内的前部。

```python
>>> re.findall(r'^.*(?:ing|ly|ed|ious|ies|ive|es|s|ment)$', 'processing')
['processing']
```

问号的其它用法之一：非贪婪匹配

```python
>>> re.findall(r'^(.*)(ing|ly|ed|ious|ies|ive|es|s|ment)$', 'processes')
[('processe', 's')]
>>> re.findall(r'^(.*?)(ing|ly|ed|ious|ies|ive|es|s|ment)$', 'processes')
[('process', 'es')]
```

#### 搜索文本

\<>可以用来匹配文本中的词。\<a> \<man>可以忽略文本中的空格进行匹配。

#### 轮到你来

> 在 W3C 日期时间格式中，日期像这样表示:2009-12-31。用正
> 则表达式替换下面 Python 代码中的“?”，将字符串'2009-12-31'转换为一
> 个整数链表[2009, 12, 31]:
> [int(n) for n in re.findall(?, '2009-12-31')]

```python
r'[0-9]+'
```

> 查找模式“as x as y”的实例以发现实体及其属性信息

```python
> h_l.findall(r'<as><\w*><as><\w*>')
